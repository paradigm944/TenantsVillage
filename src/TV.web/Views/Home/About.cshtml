                        Tenants' Village was created by a graduate student who had a lot of trouble finding quality landlords while attending college. After several leases and after losing several hundred of dollars in deposits he thought there had to be a better way.
                        A better way to find properties that do not exploit students, tenants, and landlord/tenent law.  There are good tenents out there who pay rent on time and do not destroy property, these tenants deserve the benefit of an honest landlord. 
                        And in turn there are fantastic landlords out there who desevre to have their efforts rewarded with good tenants. <br /><br />

                        There are several ways a landlord has to screen tenants: income verification, credit checks, criminal background checks, and references.  Yet there are next to no services out there to screen landlords for tenanrts.  
                        Tenants' Village fills theat need for reliable information about landlords.  This site is a safe place to voice your feedback.  <b style="color:red;">We do not allow Advertising on this site!!</b>.
